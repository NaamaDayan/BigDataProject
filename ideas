- Check third world countries for Post and Telecommunications, Transport Equipment
- Check agriculture
- Check Recycling and air pollution correlation
- Moldova, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Ukrain, Zimbabwe, Sudan in Petroleum
- Check most imported product, the countries that import it least, do they export it?
- Same as above but other way around
- Create a network of most trading countries (I think this is what you did)
- Compare the subnetworks of certain countries to information about the countries they trade with the most on the internet for example here: https://tradingeconomics.com/sudan/exports
